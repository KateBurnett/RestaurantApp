# PacMen
## MIT PacMen Coding Exercise
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Our task in this activity was to create a randomly positioned PacMan by clicking the "Add PacMan" button and have the PacMen move across the page at random velocities. We were also required to code a boundary for the PacMen to bounce off of.<br>
<br>
<b>How to Run:</b> Click "Add PacMan" too create a new PacMan at any time. Click "Start Game" to start the PacMen moving around the defined area.<br>
<br>
<b>Future improvements:</b> Future iterations will code the PacMen to "turn around" when they hit an x boarder and add a chomping motion to the PacMen.<br>
